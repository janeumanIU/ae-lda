                    <h3>Problem: early detection of drug-related adverse events</h3>
                    <p>According to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), an Adverse Event (AE) is "any undesirable experience associated with the use of a medical product." Early detection of drug-related adverse events benefits not only the drug regulators and manufacturers for pharmacovigilance, but also patients as certain adverse events can be life-threatening.</p>
                    <p>In order to capture AEs and Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs), various surveillance systems—spontaneous reporting systems (SRSs)—have been developed around the world. In the US, The FDA’s Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) is a major SRS with more than four million reports. In Europe, the European Medicines Agency developed the EudraVigilince. The World Health Organization has an international pharmacovigilance system as well. Aforementioned SRSs (particularly AERS) contain many reported post-market drugs' AEs. Although drug manufactures are required to report all known AEs, the majority of adverse events are detected by physicians and patients, where reporting is voluntary. Thus, the overall incidences of AEs can be significantly underestimated.</p>

                    <h3>Method: discovering AEs through mining social media</h3>
                    <p>Social media especially Twitter, given its deep roots in people's daily lives, 
                        has a great potential of becoming a new data feed for real-time pharmacovigilance. 
                        For example, from such a Twitter message (i.e., tweet) <i>"this warm weather + tamoxifen hot 
                        flushes is a nightmare!"</i> we can infer the possible drug use ("tamoxifen") and associated 
                        side effects ("hot flushes") about the tweet publisher. The knowledge discovered through 
                        social media mining can certainly be used to identify new adverse events in a timely 
                        manner and to confirm those adverse events reported through existing mechanisms.</p>
                    <p>In [1], we proposed an analytic framework for detection of drug-related AEs using tweets. 
                        Specifically, we built Support Vector Machine (SVM) models with textural and ontological features 
                        extracted from tweets. However, the feature extraction methods we applied are not designed for 
                        tweet-like social media contents that often contain 1) misspellings, odd abbreviations and non-word 
                        terms, and 2) fragmented and ungrammatical sentences. Thus, the identification accuracy of the 
                        models is not satisfying ( 74%). In this work, we employ a powerful topic modeling method for 
                        feature extraction. </p>

                    <br/>
                    <p>Topic models are statistical algorithms that can discover the main themes 
                        from a large unstructured collection of documents by analyzing the words of the texts. 
                        Topic models can organize the collection according to the discovered themes. One of the most
                        important features of topic models is that they do not require any prior annotations or labeling
                        of the documents—the topics emerge from the analysis of the original texts. A very nice 
                        <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~blei/papers/Blei2012.pdf">introduction</a> to topic modeling
                        by David Blei was recently published at CACM.</p>
                     <p>Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is the simplest topic model. The intuition
                        behind LDA is that documents exhibit multiple topics. For example, consider the article in Figure 1. 
                        The article "Seeking Life's Bare (Genetic) Necessities" is about using data analysis 
                        to determine the number of genes an organism needs to survive. The article comprises multiple 
                        topics such as <i> data analysis </i> (words highlighted in blue: data, number, computer) and 
                        <i> genetics </i> (words highlighted in yellow: dna, gene, genetic). LDA can be used to discover
                        those topics in an unsupervised manner. </p>
                    <p><a target="_blank" href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=5291818&tag=1">Previous study</a> 
                        has shown that LDA based feature selection is reliable and generally better than document frequency
                        based feature selection. In this study, we apply the LDA model to categorize the collection of 
                        tweets into latent topics. In the LDA model, each document (tweet(s) in our study)—treated as 
                        a vector of word counts using the bag-of-words approach—is viewed as a mixture of probabilities 
                        over the topics, where each topic is represented as a probability distribution over a set of words. 
                        We then use the probability distribution of topics as features to train the SVM prediction models. </p>

                        <p>Before applying the LDA algorithm, we first sanitize the dataset by removing 
                        the hyperlinks, hash-tags "#" and reply-tags "@", and then apply the WordNet Lemmatizer in the 
                        <a target="_blank" href="http://nltk.org/">NTLK</a> to group the different inflected forms of a word into its lemma. 
                        By doing so, we create a "clean" dictionary for the LDA model. </p>

                    <h3>Technique II: AEs discovery through mining tweets</h3>
                    <p>The process of discovering AEs from tweets has two parts: 1) identifying the 
                        users of the drug of interest, and 2) finding possible side effects attributed to the use of the drug. 
                        In both parts, an SVM classification model is built based on features extracted from tweets.
                        The overall process of tweets mining and performance improvement by using LDA based feature extraction
                        can be found in the poster below.</p>

                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <p>The performance of both SVM models has been much improved compared to the previous study. 
                        The mean accuracy of the model for identifying drug users is 79% (ROC-AUC value is 0:87). For the AE 
                        classification model, the accuracy is 81% (ROC-AUC is 0:86). We believe that the performance improvement 
                        is mainly due to the improved features.</p>
                    <p>In the previous study, the ontological features are extracted using MetaMap based on 
                        UMLS Metathesaurus concepts. The MetaMap’s NLP models are trained on biomedical literature that 
                        1) contain less language errors and 2) are formulated with standard medical terminologies. 
                        However, Twitter users have a very different vocabulary and their writing styles are usually informal. 
                        In this study, we apply the LDA model directly to the tweets without introducing a different vocabulary. 
                        Furthermore, the methods for obtaining textual features in the previous study require manual analyses of 
                        the tweets to identify language features related to the tasks. In contrast, LDA is a data-driven method, 
                        where neither prior knowledge of the topics and nor explicit "understanding" of the language is required.</p>
